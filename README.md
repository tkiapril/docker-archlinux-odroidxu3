docker-archlinux-odroidxu3
==========================

Dockerfile for Arch Linux ARM image creation on Docker for ODROID XU3.

Run `docker -t archlinux docker-archlinux-odroidxu3`(or whatever the directory
is named) to build the image.

Since this Dockerfile is dead simple, you may change the URL of ALARM image
into what you would use, although nothing is guaranteed.

This Dockerfile aims for rolling release, or no specific one.
